# Changelog

## 1.7.99 - 2026-09-24

- Version bump above Open VSX `1.7.12` so Cursor stops offering a marketplace update (`1.7.12-hardened.*` is semver-older than `1.7.12`)

## 1.7.12-hardened.3 - 2026-09-24

- Seed current models: Claude Opus/Sonnet/Fable 5.x, GPT-6 Astra, MiniMax M3/M2.7/M2.5 (drizzle _0008/_0009)

## 1.7.12-hardened.2 - 2026-09-24

- Fix dashboard "Failed to fetch" (Analytics/Settings): allow CORS OPTIONS preflight without Bearer; register CORS before auth; use http://127.0.0.1 for webview API calls

## 1.7.12-hardened.1 - 2026-09-24

- Sideload hardening: bind API to 127.0.0.1, fail-closed proxy API key auth on all routes except /health and OpenAI OAuth callback
- Stop unauthenticated /settings key leak; dashboard uses extension-injected Bearer key
- Stronger proxy API key generation (32-byte base64url)

## 1.7.12 - 2026-08-26

- Verify SHA-256 checksums for all native binary downloads (`cloudflared`, `better-sqlite3`, `sqlite3`) before execution
- Fix API server failing to start in Docker/Remote-SSH containers by accepting the editor's Node executable as a runtime candidate
- Fix selecting unsupported Node runtimes (e.g. Node 23) when a compatible Node version is available

## 1.7.11 - 2026-08-16

- Fix 400 on long chats by clamping Codex tool call IDs to 64 characters and keeping call/output pairs paired

- Fix interrupted Claude tool streams being truncated or partially executed; raise thinking default to 32k tokens

## 1.7.9 - 2026-08-13

- Fix 400 on accepting a Cursor plan with Claude models by sanitizing tool ids from plan history (`functions.X:1` → `functions_X_1`)

## 1.7.8 - 2026-08-10

- Fix 413 on multi-image Cursor requests by raising the request body limit to 256 MiB

- Sync API, tunnel, and OpenAI key-fix settings across all open Cursor windows
- Show the same API and tunnel logs in every dashboard window, with live updates and shared clear actions
- OpenAI key-fix is off by default; enable it from the dashboard or status bar if you want Ungate to keep `OpenAI API Key` enabled in Cursor
